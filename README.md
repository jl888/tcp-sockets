# A Simple TCP Server and TCP Client in Python
A simple Python TCP/IP program to demonstrate socket programming in C. Great for those who are currently studying Networking (sockets) and love programming in Python.

## Starting the Program
1. Ensure that you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Although, this program should work on Python 2 as well.

2. Open two command line windows, and for both:
```
> cd [TO]/[YOUR]/[WORKING]/[DIRECTORY]
```

3. For the Server:
```
> python3 server.py
```

4. For the Client:
```
> python3 client.py
```
